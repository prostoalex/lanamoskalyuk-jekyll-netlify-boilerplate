Cr√®me fra√Æche berry filling:  
-1 cup blueberries or blackberries  
-1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar  
-2 cups creme fraiche (you can make it at home, recipes follows)  
-2/3 cup heavy whipping cream  
-1 pint raspberries

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F  
2. Grease the bottom and sides of two 9-inch cake pans  
3. Line the bottoms with parchment paper  
4. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, salt and baking powder  
5. Beat the butter with the sugar until light, about 1 minute  
6. On medium speed, add the eggs, one at a time, beating for 30 seconds after each addition  
7. Stir together the buttermilk and the vanilla  
8. On low speed, add half of the buttermilk mixture  
9. Mix until incorporated and then scrape down the sides of the bowl  
10. Add half of the dry ingredients  
11. Mix until combined and scrape down the sides of the bowl  
12. Add the remaining buttermilk and the dry ingredients in the same order  
13. Stir in the poppyseeds  
14. Divide the batter between the two pans  
15. Evenly spread it in the pans  
16. Bake the cakes until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 25-30 minutes  
17. Cool the cakes in the pans for 10 minutes  
18. Remove the pans and let the cakes cool completely  
19. Carefully peel off the parchment paper  
20. Using a serrated knife, cut each cake in half horizontally, making a total of 4 layers  
21. Cook the blueberries and 1/4 cup of sugar in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring often, until the sugar has dissolved, about 5-7 minutets  
22. Let cool to room temperature  
23. Whip together the creme fraiche, cream and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar until stiff enough to hold its shape but smooth  
24. Place a cake layer on a serving plate  
25. Spread one quarter of the creme fraiche filling on top of the cake  
26. Top with one quarter of the blueberry sauce and then one quarter of the raspberries  
27. Place a second cake layer on top and spread creme fraiche, blueberry sauce, and raspberries on top  
28. Repeat with the third and fourth layers, ending with berries on top of the cake  
29. Refrigerate the cake, if not serving right away
