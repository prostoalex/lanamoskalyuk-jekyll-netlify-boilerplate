Instructions:  
Make Pâte Sucrée Pastry and Bake:

1. In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, process the flour, salt, sugar and butter until fine crumbs form  
2. Pour in the beaten egg yolk and water mixture just until the dough begins to stick together  
3. Do not allow the dough to form a ball or the pastry will be tough  
4. Add water or flour depending on if the dough is too dry or too wet  
5. Place dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours  
6. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F  
7. Lightly butter six 3 1/2-inch tartlet pans  
8. Roll out the pastry to about a 1/8 inch thickness  
9. Cut out six rounds, re-rolling trimmings as necessary  
10. Place rounds into tartlet pans and cut off excess pastry (pastry that is hanging over the edge)  
11. Prick the bases with a fork  
12. Line the pastry cases with foil and add a layer of baking beans  
13. Bake for 15 minutes until slightly dry and set, then remove the foil and beans and continue baking for 5 minutes more  
14. Cool on a wire rack

Prepare the Fruit and Glaze:  
1. Shortly before serving, melt the jam in a saucepan with the fruit juice over low heat  
2. Strain the glaze if necessary

After tartlets have cooled, arrange the fruit inside each tartlet and brush with glaze
